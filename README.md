- **Bundle Analysis**: Performance optimization and size monitoring
- **Performance Validation**: Speed and efficiency checks

### **Stage 3: Build & Artifact Creation**
- **Production Build**: Creates deployment-ready artifacts
- **Artifact Verification**: Ensures build integrity
- **Quality Assurance**: Final validation before deployment

### **Stage 4: Deployment**
- **Automatic Deployment**: Only if ALL previous stages pass
- **GitHub Pages Integration**: Seamless hosting deployment
- **Health Monitoring**: Post-deployment validation

### **Stage 5: Post-Deployment Validation**
